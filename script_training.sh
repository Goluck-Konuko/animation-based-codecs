MODEL="${1:-rdac}" 
##
# dac - Animation-only framework adapted from FOMM and formulated for low-bitrate compression
# hdac - Animation + enhancement base layer encoded with HEVC
# rdac - Predictive animation and residual coding
#       - End-to-end trained to animate and compress the residual difference between the animated and original frames
#       - Uses the variational autoencoder network from Image compression
#        with design features enabling the compression of sparse residuals
#      - Can be trained to exploit temporal correlations between neighbouring frame residual
#                       
#Other parameters are configured from the yaml files in <config/*> folder

#PS:: REMOVE --debug flag to actually train the models.
